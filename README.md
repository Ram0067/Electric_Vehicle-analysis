Electric Vehicle Analysis with EDA
This repository contains the analysis of electric vehicles (EVs) using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The dataset used for this project includes various attributes of electric vehicles such as brand, battery capacity, range, price, and more. We focus on univariate and bivariate analysis, along with visualizations such as racing bar plots to explore the trends in the EV industry.
EDA
Univariate Analysis
We perform univariate analysis on key features such as battery capacity, price, range, and energy consumption. This helps us to understand the distribution and central tendencies of each variable.

Example techniques:

Histograms
Box plots
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode)
Bivariate Analysis
We explore the relationships between different pairs of features, such as:

model vs. model year
vehicle count vs. location
Techniques used:

Scatter plots
Correlation matrix
Pair plots
Racing Bar Plot
A racing bar plot is used to visualize the growth of electric vehicle sales or any other time-dependent variable in the dataset, giving a dynamic view of how different EV brands or models have evolved over time.

We utilize the plotly library to create this visualization.

Technologies Used
The following libraries and tools are used for the project:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly (for racing bar plot)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive code execution
Git for version control
